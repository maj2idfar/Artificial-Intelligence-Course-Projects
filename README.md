Introduction to the Python, jupyter noteboooks, and pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries, containing a simple exploratory data analysis and a simple classification model

## CA1 - Search

Implementation of different search algorithms including BFS, DFS, IDS, A*, and Weighted A* to deliver food orders to customers in a city with certain constraints

## CA2

### Part 1 - Genetic

Implementation of crossover and mutation operations on chromosomes and genes for portofolio management (maximization of return by tuning the coefficients for a given set of stokcs)

### Part 2 - Game

Implementation of the algorithm and pruning to improve its performance for suggesting best action in Othello by observing result of the next moves

## CA3 - Na√Øve Bayes Classifier

Implementation of Gaussian and Bernoulli classifiers and Laplace smoothing for Persian hand-written digits recognition

## CA4 - Introduction to Machine Learning

Predicting house prices with different methods, including Linear Regression (manually implemented) and using the following built-in packages in scikit-learn: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest-Neighbors, Decision Tree and some Ensemble Learning methods (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)) 

## CA5

### Phase 1 - Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

Implementation of a sentiment classifier of IMDB comments (after applying lemmatization and stemming) and examining effect of different activation functions, learning rates and batch sizes

### Phase 2 - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Implementation of an image classifier on CIFAR-10 dataset using Adam optimizer , examining regularization methods, namely adding Dropout and Batch Normalization layers and examining data augmentation to handle unbalanced data
