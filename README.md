Artificial intelligence course projects at University of Tehran (Spring 2023)

## CA0 - Introduction

Introduction to the Python, jupyter noteboooks, and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) libraries, containing a simple exploratory data analysis and a simple classification model

## CA1 - Search

Implementation of different search algorithms including BFS, DFS, IDS, A*, and Weighted A* to deliver food orders to customers in a city with certain constraints

## CA2

### Part 1 - Genetic

Implementation of crossover and mutation operations on chromosomes and genes for portofolio management (maximization of return by tuning the coefficients for a given set of stokcs)

### Part 2 - Game

Implementation of the algorithm and pruning to improve its performance for suggesting best action in Othello by observing result of the next moves

## CA3 - Na√Øve Bayes Classifier

Implementation of Gaussian and Bernoulli classifiers and Laplace smoothing from scratch for Persian hand-written digits recognition

## CA4 - Introduction to Machine Learning

Predicting house prices with different methods, including Linear Regression (from scratch) and using the following built-in packages in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest-Neighbors, Decision Tree and some Ensemble Learning methods (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting ([XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/))) 

## CA5

### Phase 1 - Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

Implementation of a sentiment classifier of IMDB comments (after applying lemmatization and stemming) from scratch and using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and examining effect of different activation functions, learning rates and batch sizes

### Phase 2 - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Implementation of an image classifier on [CIFAR-10](Persian_Description) dataset using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), examining regularization methods, namely adding Dropout and Batch Normalization layers in addition to applying data augmentation to handle unbalanced data
